#### Introduction
 Housing in India varies from palaces toplaces, in big cities to tiny huts in far-flung villages. There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen.
Renting, also known as hiring or letting, is an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good, service, or property owned by another.
A gross lease is when the tenant pays a flat rental amount and the landlord pays for all property charges regularly incurred by the ownership. Renting can be an example of the sharing economy.

#### conclusion
After performing Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset, I have come to following hypothesis:
people prefere city area to take rental house it may be beacuase of easy reachability of transportation office and the places they need to go.

most of peple looks for 2 and 3 bhk apartment with semifurnished,it means people prefer not too much luxury but they need to full fill there needs within there budjut.

As the rent for most of the houses is mostly less than 0.25M, hence listings of luxurious houses are rarely posted on the platform.

Rent Feature is distributed just like salary in corporate, mostly taking average salaries and executive salaries are taken by just some.

The rent for a 6BHK is comparitive to a 3BHK. This could potentially help in getting a great deal from the owner of these 6BHK homes.

The dataset is based on metro cities where rents are usually high as compared to types of cities which have less level of facilities.

The owners of these listings are not biased towards tenant preferred but just bachelors usually have to pay higher rent as compared to owners who accept only families or both families and bachelors.

For low priced houses, contacting the owners is preferred mode of contact as it helps them in having comission. Very few listings are where builder have to be contacted as rarely builders will be directly renting houses.

Medium rent increases first with increase in number of bathrooms in the house and then decreses. This could help in identify houses that are large as they contain large number of bathrooms as well as have less rent.
